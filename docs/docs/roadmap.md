# Project Roadmap

CodeGraphContext is an evolving tool. We believe in transparency about where we are and where we are going.

## Currently Supported (Stable)

These capabilities are live in version **0.4.2**.

- **Languages (19):** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, TSX, Go, Rust, C, C++, Java, Ruby, C#, PHP, Kotlin, Scala, Swift, Dart, Perl, Haskell, and Elixir.
- **Database backends (4):** FalkorDB Lite (default on Unix with Python 3.12+), FalkorDB Remote, KuzuDB (Windows and embedded fallback), and Neo4j.
- **MCP server:** 20 tools for Cursor, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, VS Code, and other MCP clients (`cgc mcp start`).
- **Live watching:** Real-time updates via `cgc watch`.
- **Bundles and registry (shipped):** Export/import graphs and use the public bundle registry from the CLI and website.
- **Contexts:** Multiple isolated graphs (multi-graph workflows).
- **Visualization server (shipped):** Local graph exploration via `cgc visualize` (FastAPI + React UI).
- **SCIP indexing:** Available as an opt-in beta for richer symbol indexing.
- **CLI:** 55+ commands, including `cgc query` for Cypher and `cgc find` for name-based search.

## In Progress

Work underway in active development.

- **Advanced language query toolkits:** Deeper, language-aware query helpers on top of the graph.
- **Streaming for large results:** Better handling of very large query result sets.
- **More parser tests:** Broader coverage and regression tests across the Tree-sitter parsers.

## Planned

Directions we are exploring for upcoming releases.

- **SSE/HTTP MCP transport:** Alternatives to stdio for MCP hosting and integration.
- **CI/CD GitHub Action:** Automated indexing and feedback in pull-request workflows.
- **Semantic search:** Search and navigation beyond exact symbol and structural queries.
- **Cloud sync:** Optional sharing and synchronization of graphs across environments and teams.
